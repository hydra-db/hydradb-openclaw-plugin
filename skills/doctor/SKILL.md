description: Inspect HydraDB plugin config, settings, and sync state. Use when asked if HydraDB works or why recall or sync fails.

Check HydraDB plugin health for the current workspace:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/plugin.mjs" doctor --json
```

Summarize:

- whether the plugin is configured
- which config layers or files were resolved
- which API base URL is active
- the active collection (sub-tenant)
- whether auto-recall and auto-ingest are enabled
- the active `captureMode`, `searchMode`, and `ingestionMode`
- the active max prompt context budget
- the active HydraDB read and write timeouts
- how many files and sessions are currently tracked
- any config validation errors

If configuration is missing or broken, point the user to `/hydradb:setup`. If `captureMode` is `off`, mention that manual session saving is available via `/hydradb:ingest`.

If the user is specifically debugging prompt-time recall, point them to `/hydradb:last-recall`.

Do not infer that `UserPromptSubmit` hooks failed or that no HydraDB context was injected based on this output alone. It only reports configuration and tracked state; use `/hydradb:last-recall` for prompt-time recall evidence.
