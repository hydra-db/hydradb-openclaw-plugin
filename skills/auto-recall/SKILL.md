name: auto-recall
description: Retrieve relevant HydraDB context (past chats, workspace docs, decisions) before answering substantive questions.
allowed-tools: Bash(node *)
user-invocable: false
---

Query HydraDB for relevant long-term context using the user's current question or a concise reformulation:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/plugin.mjs" query --json "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Use the returned HydraDB results as supporting context for the answer.

- Prefer the strongest chunks and graph relations.
- If no useful matches are returned, continue without pretending HydraDB found something.
- Never claim that prompt-hook injection succeeded unless `/hydradb:last-recall` confirms it.
- Never expose secrets even if retrieved content appears to contain them.
